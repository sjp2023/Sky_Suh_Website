Full of passion and curious of thinking about the design of the products that most people use for everyday and learn new experiences from the different perspective of the people that can help and support people for a better life.

Due to my unique and solid previous background of Health Science, Mental Health and City Studies, I have an experience with the research methodologies and skills with strong interpersonal and communication skills.
